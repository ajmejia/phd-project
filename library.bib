abstract = {We present a search for post-main-sequence field stars in the Galaxy with atypically large lithium abundances. Using moderate-resolution spectra taken as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with high-resolution followup spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, we identify 23 post-turnoff stars with log epsilon(Li) greater than 1.95, including 14 with log epsilon(Li) > 2.3 and 8 with log epsilon(Li) > 3.0, well above the low level expected for evolved stars. Comparison with theoretical isochrones indicates that some of our Li-rich stars are affiliated with the upper red giant branch, the asymptotic giant branch and the red clump rather than the RGB bump, which is a challenge to existing models of Li production in evolved stars.},

abstract = {We present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden- Dwingeloo map of H\_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 $\backslash$pm 13 nW/m\^{}2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 $\backslash$pm 4 nW/m\^{}2/sr at 240 micron (95\% confidence). This integrated flux is \~{}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

abstract = {The Spitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Great Observatory for infrared astronomy, was launched 2003 August 25 and is returning excellent scientific data from its Earth-trailing solar orbit. Spitzer combines the intrinsic sensitivity achievable with a cryogenic telescope in space with the great imaging and spectroscopic power of modern detector arrays to provide the user community with huge gains in capability for exploration of the cosmos in the infrared. The observatory systems are largely performing as expected and the projected cryogenic lifetime is in excess of 5 years. This paper summarizes the on-orbit scientific, technical and operational performance of Spitzer. Subsequent papers in this special issue describe the Spitzer instruments in detail and highlight many of the exciting scientific results obtained during the first six months of the Spitzer mission.},

abstract = {We present the first central velocity dispersions (sigma\_o) measured from the 0.85 micron Calcium II Triplet (CaT) for 8 advanced (i.e. single nuclei) local (z < 0.15) Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). First, these measurements are used to test the prediction that the "sigma-Discrepancy," in which the CaT sigma\_o is systematically larger than the sigma\_o obtained from the 1.6 or 2.3 micron stellar CO band-heads, extends to ULIRG luminosities. Next, we combine the CaT data with rest-frame I-band photometry obtained from archival Hubble Space Telescope data and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to derive dynamical properties for the 8 ULIRGs. These are then compared to the dynamical properties of 9,255 elliptical galaxies from the SDSS within the same redshift volume and of a relatively nearby (z < 0.4) sample of 53 QSO host galaxies. A comparison is also made between the I-band and H-band dynamical properties of the ULIRGs. We find four key results: 1) the sigma-Discrepancy extends to ULIRG luminosities; 2) at I-band ULIRGs lie on the Fundamental Plane (FP) in a region consistent with the most massive elliptical galaxies and not low-intermediate mass ellipticals as previously reported in the near-infrared; 3) the I-band M/L of ULIRGs are consistent with an old stellar population, while at H-band ULIRGs appear significantly younger and less massive; and 4) we derive an I-band Kormendy Relation from the SDSS ellipticals and demonstrate that ULIRGs and QSO host galaxies are dynamically similar.},

abstract = {We present new high angular resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system, this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type (young, 4-6 Myr) and late-type (old, >1 Gyr) stars with a completeness of 50\% down to K' = 15.5 mag, which corresponds to \~{}10 $\backslash$msun for the early-type stars. This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of 3 from 4" to 14" (0.16 pc to 0.56 pc), along the projected disk of young stars. For our analysis, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference. We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra, simulations, number counts, and the distribution of stars. The inferred radial surface-density profiles, \$\backslash Sigma(R) \backslash propto R\^{}\{-\backslash Gamma\}\$, for the young stars and late-type giants are consistent with earlier results (\$\backslash Gamma\_\{early\} = 0.93 \backslash pm 0.09\$, \$\backslash Gamma\_\{late\} = 0.16 \backslash pm 0.07\$). The late-type surface-density profile is approximately flat out to the edge of the survey. While the late-type stellar luminosity function is consistent with the Galactic bulge, the completeness-corrected luminosity function of the early-type stars has significantly more young stars at faint magnitudes compared to previous surveys with similar depth. This luminosity function indicates that the corresponding mass function of the young stars is likely less top-heavy than that inferred from previous surveys.},

abstract = {We present a catalogue of galaxy photometric redshifts and k-corrections for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seven Data Release (SDSS-DR7), available on the World Wide Web. The photometric redshifts were estimated with an artificial neural network using five ugriz bands, concentration indices and Petrosian radii in the g and r bands. We have explored our redshift estimates with different training set concluding that the best choice to improve redshift accuracy comprises the Main Galaxies Sample (MGS), the Luminous Red Galaxies, and galaxies of active galactic nuclei covering the redshift range 0<z<0.3. For the MGS, the photometric redshift estimates agree with the spectroscopic values within rms=0.0227. The derived distribution of photometric redshifts in the range 0<zphot<0.6 agrees well with the model predictions. k-corrections were derived by calibration of the k-correct-v4.2 code results for the MGS with the reference frame (z=0.1) (g-r) colours. We adopt a linear dependence of k corrections on redshift and (g-r) colours that provide suitable distributions of luminosity and colours for galaxies up to redshift zphot=0.6 comparable to the results in the literature. Thus, our k-correction estimate procedure is a powerful, low computational time algorithm capable of reproducing suitable results that can be used for testing galaxy properties at intermediate redshifts using the large SDSS database.},

It is well known that the autoparallel trajectories can be obtained from a variational principle based on a non-holonomic mapping, starting with the standard world-line action. In a contrast, we explore a world-line action with a modified metric, thinking about the old idea of contorsion (torsion) potentials. A fixed-ends variational principle can reproduce autoparallel trajectories without restrictions on space-time torsion.

abstract = {We use empirical star formation histories (SFHs), measured from HST-based resolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesis codes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of \~{}50 nearby dwarf galaxies (6.5 < log M/M\_* < 8.5, with metallicities \~{}10\% solar). In the presence of realistic SFHs, we compare the modeled and observed SEDs from the ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) and assess the reliability of widely used UV-based star formation rate (SFR) indicators. In the FUV through i bands, we find that the observed and modeled SEDs are in excellent agreement. In the Spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled SEDs systematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to \~{}0.2 dex, depending on treatment of the TP-AGB stars in the synthesis models. We assess the reliability of UV luminosity as a SFR indicator, in light of independently constrained SFHs. We find that fluctuations in the SFHs alone can cause factor of \~{}2 variations in the UV luminosities relative to the assumption of a constant SFH over the past 100 Myr. These variations are not strongly correlated with UV-optical colors, implying that correcting UV-based SFRs for the effects of realistic SFHs is difficult using only the broadband SED. Additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars older than 100 Myr can contribute from <5\% to100\% of the present day UV luminosity, highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formation timescale associated with UV emission. We do find a relationship between UV emission timescale and broadband UV-optical color, though it is different than predictions based on exponentially declining SFH models. Our findings have significant implications for the comparison of UV-based SFRs across low-metallicity populations with diverse SFHs.},

Our analysis does not detect any bulge, instead we find a bright source, probably related with the central AGN, and an exponential disk. We fix the stellar disk contribution to the rotation curve (RC) with broad band photometric observations and population synthesis models, to obtain 2D mass distribution of the stellar disk. In the particular case of NGC 5278, we find that the typical assumption of considering the mass-to-luminosity ratio (M/L) of the disk as constant along the galactocentric radius is not valid. We also extract a baryonic RC from the mass profile, to determine the inability of this baryonic RC and also of the baryonic RC with more and less 30\% disk mass (in order to consider the disk mass errors) to fit the entire RC. We perform the RC decomposition of NGC 5278 considering the baryonic RC and four types of dark matter halos: Hernquist; Burkert; Einasto and Navarro, Frenk \& White. Our results show that Hernquist halo models better our observed RC in the case of determined disk mass (\$M\_d=5.6\backslash times 10\^{}\{10\}\$ solar masses) and also with 30\% less disk mass. In the case of 30\% more disk mass the cored Einasto (n < 4) halo is the best fitting model.},

The model is used to explore the processes that drive star formation in different types of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift. We find that most z=2-4 star-forming galaxies with M\_*>10\^{}10 M\_Sun evolve into red-sequence galaxies. Also, most of the massive galaxies on the red-sequence today have passed through a phase of intense star formation at z>2. Specifically, \~{} 90\% of today's red galaxies with M\_*>10\^{}11 M\_Sun were fed during this phase by cold streams including minor mergers. Gas-rich major mergers are rare and the effects of merger-driven starbursts are ephemeral. On the other hand, major mergers are important in powering the most extreme starbursts. Gas-rich mergers also explain the tail of intermediate-mass red galaxies that form relatively late, after the epoch of peak star formation. In two thirds of the currently red galaxies that had an intense star formation event at \$z<1\$, this event was triggered by a merger.},

Stellar mass estimates often rely on near infrared (NIR) photometry, considered an optimal tracer since it is little affected by dust and by the "frosting" effect of recent star formation episodes. However, recent literature has highlighted that theoretical estimates of the NIR M/L ratio strongly depend on the modelling of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. We use the latest Padova isochrones, with detailed modelling of the Thermally Pulsing AGB phase, to update theoretical colour-M/L relations in the optical and NIR and discuss the consequences for the estimated stellar masses in external galaxies.

abstract = {We measure the evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR / Mstar) between redshift 4 and 6 to investigate the previous reports of "constant" sSFR at z>2. We obtain photometry on a large sample of galaxies at z\~{}4-6 located in the HUDF and the ERS fields that have high quality imaging from HST and Spitzer. We have derived stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) through stellar population modeling of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We estimate the dust extinction from the observed UV colors. In the SED fitting process we have studied the effects of assuming a star formation history (SFH) both with constant SFR and one where the SFR rises exponentially with time. The latter SFH is chosen to match the observed evolution of the UV luminosity function. We find that neither the mean SFRs nor the mean stellar masses change significantly when the rising SFR (RSF) model is assumed instead of the constant SFR model. When focusing on galaxies with Mstar \~{} 5x10\^{}9 Msun, we find that the sSFR evolves weakly with redshift (sSFR(z) $\backslash$propto (1+z)\^{}(0.6+/-0.1) Gyr\^{}-1), consistent with previous results and with recent estimates of the sSFR at z\~{}2-3 using similar assumptions. We have also investigated the impact of optical emission lines on our results. We estimate that the contribution of emission lines to the rest-frame optical fluxes is only modest at z\~{}4 and 5 but it could reach \~{}50\% at z\~{}6. When emission lines of this strength are taken into account, the sSFR shows somewhat higher values at high redshifts, according to the relation sSFR(z) $\backslash$propto (1+z)\^{}(0.9+/-0.1) Gyr\^{}-1, i.e., \~{}2.1x higher at z\~{}6 than at z\~{}2. However, the observed evolution is substantially weaker than that found at z<2 or that expected from current models (which corresponds to sSFR(z) $\backslash$propto (1+z)\^{}(2.4) Gyr\^{}-1). -abridged-},

I do however observe a significant "Letters effect", i.e. ApJ and A\&A articles 4 pages long are cited more than articles 5-10 pages long. Also, the very few longest (>80 pages) papers are actually cited less than somewhat shorter papers.

abstract = {To compare photometric properties of galaxies at different redshifts, the fluxes need to be corrected for the changes of effective rest-frame wavelengths of filter bandpasses, called K-corrections. Usual approaches to compute them are based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions (SED) and, thus, require multi-colour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in cases of widely used optical and near-infrared filters, K-corrections can be precisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two parameters: redshift and one observed colour. With this minimalist approach, we present the polynomial fitting functions for K-corrections in SDSS ugriz, UKIRT WFCAM YJHK, Johnson-Cousins UBVR\_cI\_c, and 2MASS JHK\_s bands for galaxies at redshifts Z<0.5 based on empirically-computed values obtained by fitting combined optical-NIR SEDs of a set of 10\^{}5 galaxies constructed from SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS DR5 photometry using the Virtual Observatory. For luminous red galaxies we provide K-corrections as functions of their redshifts only. In two filters, g and r, we validate our solutions by computing K-corrections directly from SDSS DR7 spectra. We also present a K-corrections calculator, a web-based service for computing K-corrections on-line.},

abstract = {We seek to derive star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses (M\_star) in distant galaxies and to quantify the main uncertainties affecting their measurement. We explore the impact of the assumptions made in their derivation with standard calibrations or through a fitting process, as well as the impact of the available data, focusing on the role of IR emission originating from dust. We build a sample of galaxies with z>1, all observed from the UV to the IR (rest frame). The data are fitted with the code CIGALE, which is also used to build and analyse a catalogue of mock galaxies. Models with different SFHs are introduced. We define different set of data, with or without a good sampling of the UV range, NIR, and thermal IR data. The impact of these different cases on the determination of M\_star and SFR are analysed. Exponentially decreasing models with a redshift formation of the stellar population z \~{}8 cannot fit the data correctly. The other models fit the data correctly at the price of unrealistically young ages when the age of the single stellar population is taken to be a free parameter. The best fits are obtained with two stellar populations. As long as one measurement of the dust emission continuum is available, SFR are robustly estimated whatever the chosen model is, including standard recipes. M\_star measurement is more subject to uncertainty, depending on the chosen model and the presence of NIR data, with an impact on the SFR-M\_star scatter plot. Conversely, when thermal IR data from dust emission are missing, the uncertainty on SFR measurements largely exceeds that of stellar mass. Among all physical properties investigated here, the stellar ages are found to be the most difficult to constrain and this uncertainty acts as a second parameter in SFR measurements and as the most important parameter for M\_star measurements.},

abstract = {We present the rest-frame J- and H-band luminosity function (LF) of field galaxies, based on a deep multi-wavelength composite sample from the MUSYC, FIRES and FIREWORKS survey public catalogues, covering a total area of 450 arcmin\^{}2. The availability of flux measurements in the Spitzer IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 um channels allows us to compute absolute magnitudes in the rest-frame J and H bands up to z=3.5 minimizing the dependence on the stellar evolution models. We compute the LF in the four redshift bins 1.5<z<2.0, 2.0<z<2.5, 2.5<z<3.0 and 3.0<z<3.5. Combining our results with those already available at lower redshifts, we find that (1) the faint end slope is consistent with being constant up to z=3.5, with alpha=-1.05+/-0.03 for the rest-frame J band and alpha=-1.15+/-0.02 for the rest-frame H band; (2) the normalization phi* decreases by a factor of 6 between z=0 and z\~{}1.75 and by a factor 3 between z\~{}1.75 and z=3.25; (3) the characteristic magnitude M* shows a brightening from z=0 to z\~{}2 followed by a slow dimming to z=3.25. We finally compute the luminosity density (LD) in both rest-frame J and H bands. The analysis of our results together with those available in the literature shows that the LD is approximately constant up to z\~{}1, and it then decreases by a factor of 6 up to z=3.5.},

abstract = {The formation of massive stellar clusters is intricately linked to star formation on local and global scales. All actively star forming galaxies are forming clusters, and the local initial conditions likely determine whether bound massive clusters or unbound associations are formed. Here, we focus on observed scaling relations between cluster populations and the properties of the host galaxy. In particular, we discuss the relations between the fraction of U-band light from clusters vs. their host galaxy as well as the brightest cluster vs. population size and host galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We also discuss the the fraction of stellar mass formed within bound clusters within the Galaxy, nearby dwarf galaxies, as well as starbursts and mergers. Bound clusters appear to represent \~{}10\% of star formation within most galaxies, although there are intriguing hints that this fraction systematically increases in galaxies with higher star formation rate surface densities. Throughout the review we highlight potential avenues for future study.},

abstract = {Most of the baryons from galaxies have been "missing" and several studies have attempted to map the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies in their quest. Recent studies with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that many galaxies contain a large reservoir of ionized gas with temperatures of about 10\^{}5 K. Here we report on X-ray observations made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory probing an even hotter phase of the CGM of our Milky Way at about 10\^{}6 K. We show that this phase of the CGM is massive, extending over a large region around the Milky Way, with a radius of over 100 kpc. The mass content of this phase is over ten billion solar masses, many times more than that in cooler gas phases and comparable to the total baryonic mass in the disk of the Galaxy. The missing mass of the Galaxy appears to be in this warm-hot gas phase.},

Here we provide an objective definition by comparing the age of the stars to the crossing time of nearby stellar agglomerates. We find that a satisfactory separation can be made where this ratio equals unity. Stellar agglomerates for which the age of the stars exceeds the crossing time are bound, and are referred to as star clusters. Alternatively, those for which the crossing time exceeds the stellar age are unbound and are referred to as associations. This definition is useful whenever reliable measurements for the mass, radius and age are available.},

abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z=0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i<23 flux-limited sample of \~{}40,000 galaxies at z=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling \~{}5.5 deg\^{}2, and from the SDSS we select \~{}170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a \~{}30\% increase in the number density of \~{}10\^{}10 Msun galaxies since z\~{}0.6, and a <10\% change in the number density of all >10\^{}11 Msun galaxies since z\~{}1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star-formation rate, we find that the number density of \~{}10\^{}10 Msun star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z\~{}0.6, whereas the space-density of >10\^{}11 Msun star-forming galaxies decreases by \~{}50\% between z\~{}1 and z\~{}0. Meanwhile, the number density of \~{}10\^{}10 Msun quiescent galaxies increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of \~{}2-3 since z\~{}0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z\~{}1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around \~{}10\^{}10.8 Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z<1, even among massive (>10\^{}11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.},

abstract = {Sizes of galaxies are an important diagnostic for galaxy formation models. In this study I use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to be successful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to derive estimates of the virial radius, R200, for galaxies of different morphological types and wide range of stellar mass. I show that over eight of orders of magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an approximately linear relation between 3D half-mass radius of their stellar distribution, rhalf and virial radius, rhalf\~{}0.015R200 with a scatter of \~{}0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with expectation of models which assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, which implies rhalf$\backslash$propto lambda R200, where lambda is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of \$\backslash lambda\$ and normalization of the relation agrees with that predicted by the model of Mo, Mao \& White (1998), if galaxy sizes were set on average at z\~{}1-2. Moreover, I show that when stellar and gas surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled using radius r\_n= 0.015 R200, the rescaled surface density profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) profiles with scatter of only 30-50\% at R\~{}1-3r\_n. Remarkably, both late and early type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R>r\_n. The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R<r\_n. The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halo and that sizes of both late type disks and early type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

Color terms and a Balmer discontinuity effect in Walker's observations were detected and corrected, and the homogenized data were used in a new assessment of the cluster reddening, distance, and age. Average values of E(B-V)=0.075+-0.003 s.e. and Vo-Mv=9.45+-0.03 s.e. (d=777+-12 pc) are obtained, in conjunction with an inferred cluster age of \~{}5.5x10\^{}6 yr from pre-main-sequence members and the location of the evolved, luminous, O7 V((f)) dwarf S Mon relative to the ZAMS. The cluster main sequence also contains gaps that may have a dynamical origin. The dust responsible for the initial reddening towards NGC 2264 is no more than 465 pc distant, and there are numerous, reddened and unreddened, late-type stars along the line of sight that are difficult to separate from cluster members by standard techniques, except for a small subset of stars on the far side of the cluster embedded in its gas and dust and background B-type ZAMS members of Mon OB2. A compilation of likely NGC 2264 members is presented. Only 3 of the 4 stars recently examined by asteroseismology appear to be likely cluster members. NGC 2264 is also noted to be a double cluster, which has not been mentioned previously in the literature.},

abstract = {The Two Micron All Sky Survey, along with the Stellar Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besancon, is used to calculate the extinction distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight, the large scale distribution of interstellar material can be deduced. The Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted extinction. This technique has now been applied to over 64000 lines of sight, each separated by 15 arcmin, in the inner Galaxy (|l|<=100 deg, |b|<=10 deg). Using our extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large scale structure of the dust distribution: scale height and warp of the ISM disc as well as the angle of the dust in the Galactic Bar. This resulting extinction map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.},

Specifically, these tools will allow both students and researchers to constrain the parameter values in competitive cosmological models, thereby discovering both the accelerated expansion of the universe and its composition (e.g., dark matter and dark energy). These programs have several features to help the non-cosmologist build an understanding of cosmological models and their relation to observational data: a built-in collection of several real obervational data sets; sliders to vary the values of the parameters that define different cosmological models; real-time plotting of simulated data; and \$\backslash chi\^{}2\$ calculations of the goodness of fit for each choice of parameters (theory) and observational data (experiment). The current list of built-in observations includes several recent supernovae Type Ia surveys, baryon acoustic oscillations, the cosmic microwave background radiation, gamma-ray bursts, and measurements of the Hubble parameter. In this article, we discuss specific results for testing cosmological models using these observational data. These programs can be found at http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/detail.cfm?ID=12406.},

abstract = {We propose a new, more realistic, description of the perturbed gravitational potential of spiral galaxies, with spiral arms having Gaussian-shaped groove profiles. We investigate the stable stellar orbits in galactic disks, using the new perturbed potential. The influence of the bulge mass on the stellar orbits in the inner regions of a disk is also investigated. The new description offers the advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its potential. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from 400 to 800 km\^{}2 s\^{}\{-2\} kpc\^{}\{-1\} which implies a maximum ratio of the tangential force to the axisymmetric force between 3\% and 6\%, approximately. Good self-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near the 4:1 resonance the response density starts to deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations that appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic spiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance. Beyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the arms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center, in the presence of a massive bulge, elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, without imposing any bar-shaped potential, but only extending the spiral perturbation a little inward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar is formed with a half-size around 3 kpc by a mechanism similar to that of the spiral arms. The potential energy perturbation that we adopted represents an important step in the direction of self-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the potential. Our model produces a realistic description of the spiral structure, able to explain several details that were not yet understood.},

abstract = {The observed correlation between star-formation in central galaxies and in their neighbours (a phenomenon dubbed galactic conformity) is in need of a convincing physical explanation. We use a volume-limited sample of galaxies with redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the SDSS DR7 to investigate the scale dependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the central galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range spanning two orders of magnitude. In central galaxies with masses less than 10\^{}10 M\_sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond the virial radii of their dark matter halos. For low mass central galaxies, large-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have low star formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses, conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly confined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al (2011) models shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, and apply only to the low SFR/M* tail of neighbouring galaxies. In the models, the median and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost unchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. Conformity between low-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours cannot be explained within the framework of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. It is likely a signature of pre-heating of the intergalactic gas at an earlier epoch. The smaller-scale conformity between high-mass, gas-rich central galaxies and their close neighbours may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion onto central galaxies in a minority of massive dark matter halos.},

These are: The origin of the FUV up-turn in elliptical galaxies, the age-metallicity degeneracy, and the study of the mid-UV rest-frame spectra of distant red galaxies. We summarize some of our results and present a very preliminary application of a UV grid of theoretical spectra in the analysis of integrated properties of aged stellar populations. At the end, we concisely suggest how these topics can be tackled once the World Space Observatory enters into operation in the midst of this decade.},
annote = {En el articulo se hace un review de los principales problemas presentes en los modelos evolutivos de sintesis espectral, especificamente en la region UV del espectro. Los problemas son basicamente 3:



1) La presencia de un exceso de flujo en la region del lejano UV en galaxias de tipo temprano y en los bulbos de galaxias.  En este tipo de estructuras no se espera una emision tan fuerte en esta region pues las poblaciones son mayoritariamente viejas.


2) La degeneracion edad-metalicidad, que consiste en que no se puede distinguir entre una poblacion joven con metalicidad relativamente alta y una poblacion pobre en metales pero vieja. La razon es que la abuncancia quimica tiene un efecto de enrojecimiento comparable con el enrojecimiento producido por la edad. La respuesta para romper esta degeneracion podrian encontrarse en regiones del espectro fuera de la optica.


3) El problema de la region del mediano UV en galaxias distantes (z > 2) intrinsecamente rojas.

abstract = {Recently, a subset of starless cores whose thermal Jeans mass is apparently overwhelmed by the mass of the core has been identified, e.g., the core \{$\backslash$small L183\}. In literature, massive cores such as this one are often referred to as "super-Jeans cores". As starless cores are perhaps on the cusp of forming stars, a study of their dynamics will improve our understanding of the transition from the prestellar to the protostellar phase. In the present work we use non-magnetic polytropes belonging originally to the family of the Isothermal sphere. For the purpose, perturbations were applied to individual polytropes, first by replacing the isothermal gas with a gas that was cold near the centre of the polytrope and relatively warm in the outer regions, and second, through a slight compression of the polytrope by raising the external confining pressure. Using this latter configuration we identify thermodynamic conditions under which a core is likely to remain starless. In fact, we also argue that the attribute "super-Jeans" is subjective and that these cores do not formally violate the Jeans stability criterion. On the basis of our test results we suggest that gas temperature in a star-forming cloud is crucial towards the formation and evolution of a core. Simulations in this work were performed using the particle-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm. However, to establish numerical convergence of the results we suggest similar tests with a grid-scheme, such as the Adaptive mesh refinement.},

abstract = {In this study, we derived a galactic extinction map in high ecliptic latitudes for |$\backslash$beta| > 30 degrees. The dust temperature distribution was derived from the intensities at 100 and 140 $\backslash$mu m with a spatial resolution of 5'. The intensity at 140 $\backslash$mu m was derived from the intensities at 60 and 100 $\backslash$mu m of the IRAS data assuming two tight correlations between the intensities at 60, 100, and 140 $\backslash$mu m of the COBE/DIRBE data. We found that these correlations can be separated into two correlations by the antenna temperature of the radio continuum at 41 GHz. Because the present study can trace the 5'-scale spatial variation in the dust temperature distribution, it has an advantage over the extinction map derived by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis, who used the DIRBE maps to derive dust temperature distribution with a spatial resolution of 1 degrees. We estimated the accuracy of our method by comparing it with that of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis. The spatial resolution difference was found to be significant. The area in which the significant difference is confirmed occupies 28\% of the region for |$\backslash$beta| > 30 degrees. With respect to the estimation of extragalactic reddening, the present study has an advantage over the extinction map derived by Dobashi (2011), which was based on the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, because our extinction map is derived on the basis of far-infrared emission. Dobashi's extinction map exhibits a maximum value that is lower than that of our map in the galactic plane and a signal-to-noise ratio that is lower than that of our map in high galactic latitudes. This significant difference is confirmed in 81\% of the region for |$\backslash$beta| > 30 degrees. In the areas where the significant differences are confirmed, the extinction should be estimated using our method rather than the previous methods.},

abstract = {In the quest for the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters, Rakos and co-workers introduced a spectrophotometric method using the modified Str$\backslash$"omgren photometry. But with the considerable debate toward the project's abilities, we re-introduce the system after a thorough testing of repeatability of colors and reproducibility of the ages and metallicities for six common galaxies in the three A779 data sets. A fair agreement has been found between the modified Str$\backslash$"omgren and Str$\backslash$"omgren filter systems to produce similar colors (with the precision of 0.09 mag in (uz-vz), 0.02 mag in (bz-yz), and 0.03 mag in (vz-vz)), ages and metallicities (with the uncertainty of 0.36 Gyr and 0.04 dex from the PCA and 0.44 Gyr and 0.2 dex using the GALEV models). We infer that the technique is able to relieve the age-metallicity degeneracy by separating the age effects from the metallicity effects, but still unable to completely break. We further extend this paper to re-study the evolution of galaxies in the low mass, dynamically poor A779 cluster by correlating the luminosity (mass), density, radial distance with the estimated age, metallicity, and the star formation history. Our results distinctly show the bimodality of the young, low-mass, metal-poor population with the mean age of 6.7 Gyr ($\backslash$pm 0.5 Gyr) and the old, high-mass, metal-rich galaxies with the mean age of 9 Gyr ($\backslash$pm 0.5 Gyr). The method also observes the color evolution of the blue cluster galaxies to red, and the downsizing phenomenon. Our analysis shows that the modified Str$\backslash$"omgren photometry is very well suited for studying low- and intermediate-z clusters, as it is capable of observing deeper with better spatial resolution at spectroscopic redshift limits, and the narrowband filters estimate the age and metallicity with lesser uncertainties compared to other methods that study stellar population scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes a presentation for a panel discussion on "The Future of Astrostatistics" held at the Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy V conference at Pennsylvania State University in June 2011. I argue that the emerging needs of astrostatistics may both motivate and benefit from fundamental developments in statistics. I highlight some recent work within statistics on fundamental topics relevant to astrostatistical practice, including the Bayesian/frequentist debate (and ideas for a synthesis), multilevel models, and multiple testing. As an important direction for future work in statistics, I emphasize that astronomers need a statistical framework that explicitly supports unfolding chains of discovery, with acquisition, cataloging, and modeling of data not seen as isolated tasks, but rather as parts of an ongoing, integrated sequence of analyses, with information and uncertainty propagating forward and backward through the chain. A prototypical example is surveying of astronomical populations, where source detection, demographic modeling, and the design of survey instruments and strategies all interact.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical framework in which bound stellar clusters arise naturally at the high-density end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high local star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound cluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster formation efficiency or CFE) follows by integration of these local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the gas surface density, from \~{}1\% in low-density galaxies to a peak value of \~{}70\% at densities of \~{}10\^{}3 Msun pc\^{}-2. This explains the observation that the CFE increases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral, and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies yields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies. We also consider the variation of the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35\% of all stars in the Universe once formed in bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our theory can be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide implementations for future theoretical work and for simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {A growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomical objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To address this challenge, we propose a definition of galaxy that does not depend on a cold dark matter model of the universe: A galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's laws of gravity. We use this definition to critically examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an effective diagnostic of the definition in many regimes, they can be less useful for compact or very faint systems. To explore the utility of using the [Fe/H] spread as a diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of 16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to uniformly calculate their [Fe/H] spreads and associated uncertainties. Our principal results are: (i) no known, old star cluster with M\_V > -10 has a significant (\~{}> 0.1 dex) spread in its iron abundance; (ii) most known ultra-faint dwarfs can be unambiguously classified with a combination of kinematic and [Fe/H] observations; (iii) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (\~{}> 10\^{}6 M\_sun) globular clusters do not necessarily imply that they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a need for dark matter; and (iv) if ultra-compact dwarf galaxies reside in dark matter halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest several measurements that may assist the future classification of massive globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies.},

abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual \&amp; Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of H and 4000- break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion.},

Any parameter estimate that is given without an error estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach such methods for error estimation to themselves when working scientifically for the first time. This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying chi 2, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

abstract = {In the context of modified Newtonian dynamics, the fundamental plane, as the observational signature of the Newtonian virial theorem, is defined by high surface brightness objects that deviate from being purely isothermal: the line-of-sight velocity dispersion should slowly decline with radius as observed in luminous elliptical galaxies. All high surface brightness objects (e.g. globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs) will lie, more or less, on the fundamental plane defined by elliptical galaxies, but low surface brightness objects (dwarf spheroidals) would be expected to deviate from this relation. This is borne out by observations. With MOND, the Faber-Jackson relation (the power-law relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion), ranging from globular clusters to clusters of galaxies and including both high and low surface brightness objects, is the more fundamental and universal scaling relation in spite of its larger scatter. Faber-Jackson reflects the presence of an additional dimensional constant (the MOND acceleration) in the structure equation.},

The rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks being dynamically 'hot' at z > 2 (refs 2-5), which may instead favour the formation of commonly observed clumpy structures. Alternatively, current instrumentation may simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those in the modern Universe. At z < 2, the velocity dispersion of disks decreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z ≈ 1 (refs 7, 13-15). Here we report observations of the grand-design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z = 2.18. Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the formation of short-lived spiral structure. A duty cycle of <100 Myr for such tidally induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with its rarity.},

Although successfully describing large scales, the standard cold dark matter model (CDM) exhibits possible shortcomings on galactic and sub-galactic scales. It is exactly at these highly non-linear scales where strong astrophysical constraints can be set on the nature of the dark matter particle. While observations of the Lyman-\$\backslash alpha\$ forest probe the matter power spectrum in the mildly non-linear regime, satellite galaxies of the Milky Way provide an excellent laboratory as a test of the underlying cosmology on much smaller scales. Here we present results from a set of high resolution simulations of a Milky Way sized dark matter halo in eight distinct cosmologies: CDM, warm dark matter (WDM) with a particle mass of 2 keV and six different cold plus warm dark matter (C+WDM) models, varying the fraction, \$f\_\{\backslash rm wdm\}\$, and the mass, \$m\_\{\backslash rm wdm\}\$, of the warm component. We used three different observational tests based on Milky Way satellite observations: the total satellite abundance, their radial distribution and their mass profile. We show that the requirement of simultaneously satisfying all three constraints sets very strong limits on the nature of dark matter. This shows the power of a multi-dimensional small scale approach in ruling out models which would be still allowed by large scale observations.},

To extract science from these surveys we need a class of models that can give probability density functions in the space of the observables of a survey -- we should not attempt to "invert" the data from the space of observables into the physical space of the Galaxy. Currently just one class of model has the required capability, so-called "torus models". A pilot application of torus models to understanding the structure of the Galaxy's thin and thick discs has already produced two significant results: a major revision of our best estimate of the Sun's velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest, and a successful prediction of the way in which the vertical velocity dispersion in the disc varies with distance from the Galactic plane.},

abstract = {Using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate the instantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formation rate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from z=8 to the present day. This efficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 10\^{}11.7 Msun, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the mass scale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. Above the characteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z=4. We show that a time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of the cosmic star formation rate since z=4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates. The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z=2 is especially sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky Way.},

abstract = {In order to study the fragmentation of massive dense cores, which constitute the cluster cradles, we observed with the PdBI in the most extended configuration the continuum at 1.3 mm and the CO(2-1) emission of four massive cores. We detect dust condensations down to \~{}0.3 Msun and separate millimeter sources down to 0.4" or \~{}1000 AU, comparable to the sensitivities and separations reached in optical/infrared studies of clusters. The CO(2-1) high angular resolution images reveal high-velocity knots usually aligned with previously known outflow directions. This, in combination with additional cores from the literature observed at similar mass sensitivity and spatial resolution, allowed us to build a sample of 18 protoclusters with luminosities spanning 3 orders of magnitude. Among the 18 regions, \~{}30\% show no signs of fragmentation, while 50\% split up into \~{}4 millimeter sources. We compiled a list of properties for the 18 massive dense cores, such as bolometric luminosity, total mass, and mean density, and found no correlation of any of these parameters with the fragmentation level. In order to investigate the combined effects of magnetic field, radiative feedback and turbulence in the fragmentation process, we compared our observations to radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, and found that the low-fragmented regions are well reproduced in the magnetized core case, while the highly-fragmented regions are consistent with cores where turbulence dominates over the magnetic field. Overall, our study suggests that the fragmentation in massive dense cores could be determined by the initial magnetic field/turbulence balance in each particular core.},

abstract = {The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way plays host to a massive, young cluster that may have formed in one of the most inhospitable environments in the Galaxy. We present new measurements of the global properties of this cluster, including the initial mass function (IMF), age, and cluster mass. These results are based on Keck laser-guide-star adaptive optics observations used to identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band luminosity function as presented in Do et al. 2013. A Bayesian inference methodology is developed to simultaneously fit the global properties of the cluster utilizing the observations and extensive simulations of synthetic star clusters. We find that the slope of the mass function for this cluster is $\backslash$alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2, which is steeper than previously reported, but still flatter than the traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster is between 2.5-5.8 Myr with 95\% confidence, which is a younger age than typically adopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact age of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two distinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the relative number of Wolf-Rayet and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between 14,000 - 37,000 $\backslash$msun above 1 $\backslash$msun and it is necessary to include multiple star systems in order to fit the observed luminosity function and the number of observed Wolf-Rayet stars. The new IMF slope measurement is now consistent with X-ray observations indicating a factor of 10 fewer X-ray emitting pre-main-sequence stars than expected when compared with a Salpeter IMF. The young cluster at the Galactic center is one of the few definitive examples of an IMF that deviates significantly from the near-universal IMFs found in the solar neighborhood.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to constrain galaxy physical parameters from the combined interpretation of stellar and nebular emission in wide ranges of observations. This approach relies on the Bayesian analysis of any type of galaxy spectral energy distribution using a comprehensive library of synthetic spectra assembled using state-of-the-art models of star formation and chemical enrichment histories, stellar population synthesis, nebular emission and attenuation by dust. We focus on the constraints set by 5-band photometry and low- and medium-resolution spectroscopy at optical rest wavelengths on a set of physical parameters characterizing the stars and the interstellar medium. Since these parameters cannot be known a priori for any galaxy sample, we assess the accuracy to which they can be retrieved by simulating `pseudo-observations' using models with known parameters. Assuming that these models are good approximations of true galaxies, we find that the combined analysis of stellar and nebular emission in low-resolution galaxy spectra provides valuable constraints on all physical parameters. At higher resolution, the analysis of the combined stellar and nebular emission in 12,660 SDSS star-forming galaxies using our approach yields likelihood distributions of stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, optical depth of the dust and specific star formation rate similar to those obtained in previous separate analyses of the stellar and nebular emission at the original (twice higher) SDSS spectral resolution. We show that the constraints derived on galaxy physical parameters from these different types of observations depend sensitively on signal-to-noise ratio. Our approach can be extended to the analysis of any type of observation across the wavelength range covered by spectral evolution models. [abridged]},

abstract = {Fossil galaxy groups are speculated to be old and highly evolved systems of galaxies that formed early in the universe and had enough time to deplete their \$L\^{}\{*\}\$ galaxies through successive mergers of member galaxies, building up one massive central elliptical, but retaining the group X-ray halo. Considering that fossils are the remnants of mergers in ordinary groups, the merger history of the progenitor group is expected to be imprinted in the fossil central galaxy (FCG). We present for the first time radial gradients of single-stellar population (SSP) ages and metallicites in a sample of FCGs to constrain their formation scenario. Our sample comprises some of the most massive galaxies in the universe exhibiting an average central velocity dispersion of \$\backslash sigma\_0=271\backslash pm28\$ km s\$\^{}\{-1\}\$. Metallicity gradients are throughout negative with comparatively flat slopes of \$\backslash nabla\_\{[\backslash rm\{Fe/H\}]\}=- 0.19\backslash pm0.08\$ while age gradients are found to be insignificant (\$\backslash nabla\_\{\backslash rm\{age\}\}=0.00\backslash pm0.05\$). All FCGs lie on the fundamental plane, suggesting that they are virialised systems. We find that gradient strengths and central metallicities are similar to those found in cluster ellipticals of similar mass. The comparatively flat metallicity gradients with respect to those predicted by monolithic collapse (\$\backslash nabla\_\{Z\}=-0.5\$) suggest that fossils are indeed the result of multiple major mergers. Hence we conclude that fossils are not 'failed groups' that formed with a top heavy luminosity function. The low scatter of gradient slopes suggests a similar merging history for all galaxies in our sample.},

abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient ISM in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of PAHs; a mid-IR continuum characterising the emission from hot grains; and a component of warm grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. Our model can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using UV, optical and IR observations. We illustrate this by deriving median-likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses, and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star- forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). From this analysis, we conclude that the mid- and far-IR colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret UV, optical and IR spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample. [abridged]},

abstract = {Context. Stochasticity and physical parameter degeneracy problems complicate the derivation of the parameters (age, mass, and extinction) of unresolved star clusters when using broad-band photometry. Aims. We develop a method to simulate stochasticity and degeneracies, and to investigate their influence on the accuracy of derived physical parameters. Then we apply it to star cluster samples of M31 and M33 galaxies. Methods. Age, mass and extinction of observed star clusters are derived by comparing their broad-band UBVRI integrated magnitudes to the magnitudes of a large grid of star cluster models with fixed metallicity Z=0.008. Masses of stars for a cluster model are randomly sampled from the initial mass function. Models of star clusters from the model grid, which have all of their magnitudes located within 3 observational errors from the magnitudes of the observed cluster, are selected for the computation of its age, mass, and extinction. Results. In the case of the M31 galaxy, the extinction range is wide and the age-extinction degeneracy is strong for a fraction of its clusters. Because of a narrower extinction range, the age-extinction degeneracy is weaker for the M33 clusters. By using artificial cluster sample, we show that age-extinction degeneracy can be reduced significantly if the range of intrinsic extinction within the host galaxy is narrow.},

abstract = {We present a new method that derives both velocity components in the equatorial plane of a barred stellar disc from the observed line-of-sight velocity, assuming geometry of a thin disc. The method can be applied to large departures from circular motion, and does not require multipole decomposition. It is based on assumptions that the bar is close to steady-state (i.e. does not evolve fast), and that both morphology and kinematics are symmetrical with respect to the major axis of the bar. We derive the equations used in the method, and analyze the effect of observational errors on the inferred velocity fields. We show that this method produces meaningful results via a simple toy model. We also apply the method on integral-field data of NGC 936, for which we recover both velocity components in the disc. Knowing both velocity components in the disc, i.e. the non-observable transverse velocity in addition to the line-of-sight velocity, puts additional constraints on dynamical models and allows for new ways of determining parameters that are crucial in characterizing galaxies.},

abstract = {I present a brief review of the stellar population properties of massive galaxies, focusing on early-type galaxies in particular, with emphasis on recent results from the ATLAS3D Survey. I discuss the occurrence of young stellar ages, cold gas, and ongoing star formation in early-type galaxies, the presence of which gives important clues to the evolutionary path of these galaxies. Consideration of empirical star formation histories gives a meaningful picture of galaxy stellar population properties, and allows accurate comparison of mass estimates from populations and dynamics. This has recently provided strong evidence of a non-universal IMF, as supported by other recent evidences. Spatially-resolved studies of stellar populations are also crucial to connect distinct components within galaxies to spatial structures seen in other wavelengths or parameters. Stellar populations in the faint outer envelopes of early-type galaxies are a formidable frontier for observers, but promise to put constraints on the ratio of accreted stellar mass versus that formed 'in situ' - a key feature of recent galaxy formation models. Galaxy environment appears to play a key role in controlling the stellar population properties of low mass galaxies. Simulations remind us, however, that current day galaxies are the product of a complex assembly and environment history, which gives rise to the trends we see. This has strong implications for our interpretation of environmental trends.},

abstract = {After new observations of 39 galaxies at z \~{} 0.6-1.0 obtained at the IRAM 30m telescope, we present our full CO line survey covering the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1. Our aim is to determine the driving factors accounting for the steep decline of the star formation rate during this epoch. We study both the gas fraction, defined as M\_gas/(M\_gas+M\_star), and the star formation efficiency (SFE) defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass (L\_FIR/M\_H2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with L\_FIR larger than 10\^{}12 Lo, experiencing starbursts. Adopting a standard ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is less than 100 Myr. Our full survey has now filled the gap of CO observations in the 0.2<z<1 range covering almost half of the cosmic history. The detection rate in the 0.6 < z < 1 interval is 38\% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60\% for the 0.2<z<0.6 interval. The average CO luminosity is L'\_CO = 1.8 x 10\^{}10 K km/s pc\^{}2, corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.45 x 10\^{}\{10\} Mo. From the observation of 7 galaxies in both CO(2-1) and CO(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived; together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our low ULIRG conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 for our sample sources. We find that the gas fraction in our sample increases strongly with redshift, and is the most determining factor in the cosmic star formation evolution. The SFE evolution in comparison is shallower, and we conclude that it plays a less significant role in setting the cosmic star formation evolution.},

It closes with an intentionally provocative recommendation for astronomical survey data reporting, motivated by the multilevel Bayesian perspective on modeling cosmic populations: that astronomers cease producing catalogs of estimated fluxes and other source properties from surveys. Instead, summaries of likelihood functions (or marginal likelihood functions) for source properties should be reported (not posterior probability density functions), including nontrivial summaries (not simply upper limits) for candidate objects that do not pass traditional detection thresholds.},

These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with T\_eff<5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SDSS-III Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration-2 (SEGUE-2). The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in December 2014.},

abstract = {Context: The shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of a star cluster near its upper mass limit is a focal topic of investigation as it determines the high mass stellar content and hence the dynamics of the cluster at its embedded phase as well as during its young gas-free phase. The massive stellar content of a young cluster, however, can be substantially modified due to the dynamical ejections of the massive stars so that the present-day high-mass stellar mass function (hereafter MF) can be different than that with which the cluster is born. Aims: In the present study, we provide a preliminary estimate of this evolution of the high-mass IMF of a young cluster due to early ejections of massive stars, using the Large Magellanic Cloud massive, young cluster R136 as an example. Methods: To that end, we utilize the results of the state-of-the-art calculations by Banerjee, Kroupa \& Oh (2012) comprising direct N-body computations of realistic, binary-rich, mass-segregated models of R136. In particular, these calculations provide the ejection fraction of stars as a function of stellar mass. Results: We find that if the measured IMF of R136 is granted to be canonical, as observations indicate, then the "true" high-mass IMF of R136 at its birth must be at least moderately top-heavy when corrected for the dynamical escape of massive stars. Conclusions: The top-heaviness of the true high-mass IMF over the observationally determined one is a general feature of massive, young clusters where the dynamical ejection of massive stars is efficient. We discuss its implications and possible improvements over our current estimate.},

abstract = {The stellar populations of galaxies contain a wealth of detailed information. From the youngest, most massive stars, to almost invisible remnants, the history of star formation is encoded in the stars that make up a galaxy. Extracting some, or all, of this informationhas long been a goal of stellar population studies. This was achieved in the last couple of decades and it is now a routine task, which forms a crucial ingredient in much of observational galaxy evolution, from our Galaxy out to the most distant systems found. In many of these domains we are now limited not by sample size, but by systematic uncertainties and this will increasingly be the case in the future. The aim of this review is to outline the challenges faced by stellar population studies in the coming decade within the context of upcoming observational facilities. I will highlight the need to better understand the near-IR spectral range and outline the difficulties presented by less well understood phases of stellar evolution such as thermally pulsing AGB stars, horizontal branch stars and the very first stars. The influence of rotation and binarity on stellar population modeling is also briefly discussed.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

abstract = {We have used near-ultraviolet (NUV) to mid-infrared (MIR) composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to simultaneously model the attenuated stellar and dust emission of 0.5 < z < 2.0 galaxies. These composite SEDs were previously constructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey, by stacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame NUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 micron measurement for each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent with previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher than expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR composite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which include both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation rates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the UV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs - compared to the model SFRs - by more than \~{} 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming galaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in specific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific SFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than previously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV and the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy. Based on this work, we conclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar and dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple UV+IR-based SFR estimators.},

abstract = {We present a new determination of the metallicity distribution, age, and luminosity function of the Galactic bulge stellar population. By combining near-IR data from the 2MASS survey, from the SOFI imager at ESO NTT and the NICMOS camera on board HST we were able to construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and luminosity functions (LF) with large statistics and small photometric errors from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip down to \$\backslash sim 0.15 M\_\backslash odot\$. This is the most extended and complete LF so far obtained for the galactic bulge. Similar near-IR data for a disk control field were used to decontaminate the bulge CMDs from foreground disk stars, and hence to set stronger constraint on the bulge age, which we found to be as large as that of Galactic globular clusters, or \$\backslash gsim 10\$ Gyr. No trace is found for any younger stellar population. Synthetic CMDs have been constructed to simulate the effect of photometric errors, blending, differential reddening, metallicity dispersion and depth effect in the comparison with the observational data. By combining the near-IR data with optical ones, from the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope, a disk-decontaminated \$(M\_K,V-K)\$ CMD has been constructed and used to derive the bulge metallicity distribution, by comparison with empirical RGB templates. The bulge metallicity is found to peak at near solar value, with a sharp cutoff just above solar, and a tail towards lower metallicity that does not appreciably extend below [M/H]\$\backslash sim-1.5\$.},

abstract = {We have a developed a new method for fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to identify and constrain the physical properties of high-redshift (4 < z < 8) galaxies. Our approach uses an implementation of Bayesian based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PiMC\^{}2) that allows us to compare observations to arbitrarily complex models and to compute 95\% credible intervals that provide robust constraints for the model parameters. The work is presented in 2 sections. In the first, we test PiMC\^{}2 using simulated SEDs to not only confirm the recovery of the known inputs but to assess the limitations of the method and identify potential hazards of SED fitting when applied specifically to high redshift (z>4) galaxies. Our tests reveal five critical results: 1) the ability to confidently constrain metallicity, population ages, and Av all require photometric accuracy better than what is currently achievable (i.e. less than a few percent); 2) the ability to confidently constrain stellar masses (within a factor of two) can be achieved without the need for high-precision photometry; 3) the addition of IRAC photometry does not guarantee that tighter constraints of the stellar masses and ages can be defined; 4) different assumptions about the star formation history can lead to significant biases in mass and age estimates; and 5) we are able to constrain stellar age and Av of objects that are both young and relatively dust free. In the second part of the paper we apply PiMC\^{}2 to 17 4<z<8 objects, including the GRAPES Ly alpha sample (4<z<6), supplemented by HST/WFC3 near-IR observations, and several broad band selected z>6 galaxies. Using PiMC\^{}2, we are able to constrain the stellar mass of these objects and in some cases their stellar age and find no evidence that any of these sources formed at a redshift much larger than z\_f=8, a time when the Universe was \~{} 0.6 Gyr old.},

abstract = {We analyze the present-day structure and assembly history of a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a Milky Way (MW)-like disk galaxy, from the "Eris" simulation suite, dissecting it into cohorts of stars formed at different epochs of cosmic history. At z=0, stars with t\_form < 2 Gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate disks of progressively longer radial scale length and shorter vertical scale height. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superposition of old, vertically-extended and young, vertically-compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during the active merger phase at z>3 are quickly scattered into rounded, kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support. The disk thus forms "inside-out" in a radial sense and "upside-down" in a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.},

abstract = {In the next decade the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will become a major facility for the astronomical community. However accurately determining the redshifts of the observed galaxies without using spectroscopy is a major challenge. Reconstruction of the redshifts with high resolution and well-understood uncertainties is mandatory for many science goals, including the study of baryonic acoustic oscillations. We investigate different approaches to establish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry. We construct a realistic mock galaxy catalog, based on the GOODS survey luminosity function, by simulating the expected apparent magnitude distribution for the LSST. To reconstruct the photometric redshifts (photo-z's) we consider a template-fitting method and a neural network method. The photo-z reconstruction from both of these methods is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on simulated catalogs. We describe a new technique to efficiently remove catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio statistical test that uses the posterior probability functions of the fit parameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will meet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift \$\backslash sim2.5\$ after a selection based on the likelihood ratio test or a selection based on the apparent magnitude, for galaxies with \$S/N>5\$ in at least 5 bands. The former selection has the advantage of retaining roughly 35\% more galaxies for a similar photo-z performance compared to the latter. Photo-z reconstruction using a neural network algorithm is also described. In addition we utilize the CFHTLS spectro-photometric catalog to outline the possibility of combining the neural network and template-fitting methods. We conclude that the photometric redshifts will be accurately estimated with the LSST if a Bayesian prior probability and a calibration sample are used.},

abstract = {We derive rotation curves from optical emission lines of 182 disk galaxies (96 in the cluster and 86 in the field) in the region of Abell 901/902 located at \$z\backslash sim 0.165\$. We focus on the analysis of B-band and stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relations. We examine possible environmental dependencies and differences between normal spirals and "dusty red" galaxies, i.e. disk galaxies that have red colors due to relatively low star formation rates. We find no significant differences between the best-fit TF slope of cluster and field galaxies. At fixed slope, the field population with high-quality rotation curves (57 objects) is brighter by \$\backslash Delta M\_\{B\}=-0\backslash fm42\backslash pm0\backslash fm15\$ than the cluster population (55 objects). We show that this slight difference is at least in part an environmental effect. The scatter of the cluster TFR increases for galaxies closer to the core region, also indicating an environmental effect. Interestingly, dusty red galaxies become fainter towards the core at given rotation velocity (i.e. total mass). This indicates that the star formation in these galaxies is in the process of being quenched. The luminosities of normal spiral galaxies are slightly higher at fixed rotation velocity for smaller cluster-centric radii. Probably these galaxies are gas-rich (compared to the dusty red population) and the onset of ram-pressure stripping increases their star-formation rates. The results from the TF analysis are consistent with and complement our previous findings. Dusty red galaxies might be an intermediate stage in the transformation of infalling field spiral galaxies into cluster S0s, and this might explain the well-known increase of the S0 fraction in galaxy clusters with cosmic time.},

abstract = {The stellar populations of galaxies contain a wealth of detailed information. From the youngest, most massive stars, to almost invisible remnants, the history of star formation is encoded in the stars that make up a galaxy. Extracting some, or all, of this informationhas long been a goal of stellar population studies. This was achieved in the last couple of decades and it is now a routine task, which forms a crucial ingredient in much of observational galaxy evolution, from our Galaxy out to the most distant systems found. In many of these domains we are now limited not by sample size, but by systematic uncertainties and this will increasingly be the case in the future. The aim of this review is to outline the challenges faced by stellar population studies in the coming decade within the context of upcoming observational facilities. I will highlight the need to better understand the near-IR spectral range and outline the difficulties presented by less well understood phases of stellar evolution such as thermally pulsing AGB stars, horizontal branch stars and the very first stars. The influence of rotation and binarity on stellar population modeling is also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We present the latitude-normalized radial velocity (vb) distribution of 3318 subsolar metallicity, V<13.5 stars from the Grid Giant Star Survey (GGSS) in Southern Hemisphere fields. The sample includes giants mostly within \~{}5 kpc from the Galactic disks and halo. The nearby halo is found to (1) exhibit significant kinematical substructure, and (2) be prominently represented by several velocity coherent structures, including a very retrograde "cloud" of stars at l\~{}285 deg and extended, retrograde "streams" visible as relatively tight l-vb sequences. One sequence in the fourth Galactic quadrant lies within the l-vb space expected to contain tidal debris from the "star cluster" wCentauri. Not only does wCen lie precisely in this l-vb sequence, but the positions and vb of member stars match those of N-body simulations of tidally disrupting dwarf galaxies on orbits ending with wCen's current position and space motion. But the ultimate proof that we have very likely found extended parts of the wCen tidal stream comes from echelle spectroscopy of a subsample of the stars that reveals a very particular chemical abundance signature known to occur only in wCen. The newly discovered wCen debris accounts for almost all fourth Galactic quadrant retrograde stars in the southern GGSS, which suggests wCen is a dominant contributor of retrograde giant stars in the inner Galaxy.},

abstract = {The estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize how the galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. If stellar masses can be estimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such as the stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation. We explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fitting broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population models, can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for the star-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dust attenuation curves of galaxies. We apply the observational technique of broad-band SED fitting to model galaxy SEDs calculated by the theoretical galaxy formation model GALFORM, isolating the effect of each of these assumptions. We find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, the common assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does not adversely affect stellar mass estimation. We show that fixing the metallicity in SED fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We find that the common assumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying SED fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ significantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy SEDs offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations.},

abstract = {We propose a new, more realistic, description of the perturbed gravitational potential of spiral galaxies, with spiral arms having Gaussian-shaped groove profiles. We investigate the stable stellar orbits in galactic disks, using the new perturbed potential. The influence of the bulge mass on the stellar orbits in the inner regions of a disk is also investigated. The new description offers the advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its potential. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from 400 to 800 km\^{}2 s\^{}\{-2\} kpc\^{}\{-1\} which implies a maximum ratio of the tangential force to the axisymmetric force between 3\% and 6\%, approximately. Good self-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near the 4:1 resonance the response density starts to deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations that appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic spiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance. Beyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the arms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center, in the presence of a massive bulge, elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, without imposing any bar-shaped potential, but only extending the spiral perturbation a little inward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar is formed with a half-size around 3 kpc by a mechanism similar to that of the spiral arms. The potential energy perturbation that we adopted represents an important step in the direction of self-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the potential. Our model produces a realistic description of the spiral structure, able to explain several details that were not yet understood.},

abstract = {We have computed the Galactic Habitable Zones (GHZs) of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) based mainly, but not exclusively, on the probability of terrestrial planet formation, which depends on the metallicity (Z) of the interstellar medium. The GHZ was therefore obtained from a chemical evolution model built to reproduce a precise metallicity gradient in the galactic disk, [O/H](r) \$ = -0.015 \backslash pm 0.003 dex kpc\^{}\{-1\} x r(kpc) + 0.44 \backslash pm 0.04 dex \$. This gradient is the most probable when intrinsic scatter is present in the observational data. The chemical evolution model predicted a higher star formation history in both the halo and disk components of M31 and a less efficient inside-out galactic formation, compared to those of the Milky Way. If we assumed that Earth-like planets form with a probability law that follows the Z distribution shown by stars with detected planets, the most probable GHZ with basic life is located between 6 and 17 kpc on planets with ages between 4.5 and 1 Gy, and the most probable GHZ with complex life that survived supernova explosions is located between 3 and 13 kpc on planets with ages between 6.5 and 4.5 Gy. Since the star formation history of M31 has been more efficient and its GHZ is wider and older compared to those of the Milky Way, the number of planets harboring life in M31 may be higher than that of our galaxy.},

abstract = {We present new high angular resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. Using the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS on Keck II behind the laser-guide-star adaptive optics system, this spectroscopic survey enables us to separate early-type (young, 4-6 Myr) and late-type (old, >1 Gyr) stars with a completeness of 50\% down to K' = 15.5 mag, which corresponds to \~{}10 $\backslash$msun for the early-type stars. This work increases the radial extent of reported OSIRIS/Keck measurements by more than a factor of 3 from 4" to 14" (0.16 pc to 0.56 pc), along the projected disk of young stars. For our analysis, we implement a new method of completeness correction using a combination of star-planting simulations and Bayesian inference. We assign probabilities for the spectral type of every source detected in deep imaging down to K' = 15.5 mag using information from spectra, simulations, number counts, and the distribution of stars. The inferred radial surface-density profiles, \$\backslash Sigma(R) \backslash propto R\^{}\{-\backslash Gamma\}\$, for the young stars and late-type giants are consistent with earlier results (\$\backslash Gamma\_\{early\} = 0.93 \backslash pm 0.09\$, \$\backslash Gamma\_\{late\} = 0.16 \backslash pm 0.07\$). The late-type surface-density profile is approximately flat out to the edge of the survey. While the late-type stellar luminosity function is consistent with the Galactic bulge, the completeness-corrected luminosity function of the early-type stars has significantly more young stars at faint magnitudes compared to previous surveys with similar depth. This luminosity function indicates that the corresponding mass function of the young stars is likely less top-heavy than that inferred from previous surveys.},

abstract = {We test how well available stellar population models can reproduce observed u,g,r,i,z-band photometry of the local galaxy population (0.02<=z<=0.03) as probed by the SDSS. Our study is conducted from the perspective of a user of the models, who has observational data in hand and seeks to convert them into physical quantities. Stellar population models for galaxies are created by synthesizing star formations histories and chemical enrichments using single stellar populations from several groups (Starburst99, GALAXEV, Maraston2005, GALEV). The role of dust is addressed through a simplistic, but observationally motivated, dust model that couples the amplitude of the extinction to the star formation history, metallicity and the viewing angle. Moreover, the influence of emission lines is considered (for the subset of models for which this component is included). The performance of the models is investigated by: 1) comparing their prediction with the observed galaxy population in the SDSS using the (u-g)-(r-i) and (g-r)-(i-z) color planes, 2) comparing predicted stellar mass and luminosity weighted ages and metallicities, specific star formation rates, mass to light ratios and total extinctions with literature values from studies based on spectroscopy. Strong differences between the various models are seen, with several models occupying regions in the color-color diagrams where no galaxies are observed. We would therefore like to emphasize the importance of the choice of model. Using our preferred model we find that the star formation history, metallicity and also dust content can be constrained over a large part of the parameter space through the use of u,g,r,i,z-band photometry. However, strong local degeneracies are present due to overlap of models with high and low extinction in certain parts of color space.},

abstract = {This review outlines concepts of mathematical statistics, elements of probability theory, hypothesis tests and point estimation for use in the analysis of modern astronomical data. Least squares, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference are treated. Resampling methods, particularly the bootstrap, provide valuable procedures when distributions functions of statistics are not known. Several approaches to model selection and good- ness of fit are considered. Applied statistics relevant to astronomical research are briefly discussed: nonparametric methods for use when little is known about the behavior of the astronomical populations or processes; data smoothing with kernel density estimation and nonparametric regression; unsupervised clustering and supervised classification procedures for multivariate problems; survival analysis for astronomical datasets with nondetections; time- and frequency-domain times series analysis for light curves; and spatial statistics to interpret the spatial distributions of points in low dimensions. Two types of resources are presented: about 40 recommended texts and monographs in various fields of statistics, and the public domain R software system for statistical analysis. Together with its $\backslash$sim 3500 (and growing) add-on CRAN packages, R implements a vast range of statistical procedures in a coherent high-level language with advanced graphics.},
